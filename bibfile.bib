Instead of relying on square lattices it is possible to use rectangular and orthorombic lattices as well. Schemes using rectangular lattices can be constructed in several ways. Here we construct a rectangular scheme, with the BGK collision operator, by introducing 2 additional discrete velocities into the standard D2Q9 stencil and show how the same procedure can be applied in three dimensions by extending the D3Q19 stencil. The weights and scaling factors for the new stencils are found as the solutions of the well-known Hermite quadrature problem, assuring isotropy of the lattice tensors up to rank four (Philippi et al., Phys. Rev. E 73(5):056702, 2006) This isotropy is a necessary and sufficient condition for assuring the same second order accuracy of lattice-Boltzmann equation with respect to the Navier–Stokes hydrodynamic equations that is found with the standard D2Q9 and D3Q19 stencils. The numerical validation is done, in the two-dimensional case, by using the new rectangular scheme with D2R11 stencil for simulating the Taylor–Green vortex decay. The D3R23 stencil is numerically validated with three-dimensional simulations of cylindrical sound waves propagating from a point source.},

Examples of such complex dynamics are multiphase and multicomponent flows for which several LB models have already been proposed. However, due to theoretical or numerical reasons, some of these models may require application of high-order lattice-Boltzmann equations (LBEs) and stencils. Here, we will present a derivation of LBEs from the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation (DVBE). By using the method of characteristics, high-order accurate equations are conveniently formulated with standard numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In particular, we will derive implicit LB schemes due to their stability properties. A simple algorithm is presented which enables implementation of the implicit schemes without resorting to, e.g. change of variables. Finally, some numerical experiments with high-order equations and stencils together with two specific multiphase models are presented.},

  abstract  = {We propose isotropic finite differences for high-accuracy approximation of high-rank derivatives. These finite differences are
based on direct application of lattice-Boltzmann stencils. The presented finite-difference expressions are valid in any dimension,
particularly in two and three dimensions, and any lattice-Boltzmann stencil isotropic enough can be utilized. A theoretical basis
for the proposed utilization of lattice-Boltzmann stencils in the approximation of high-rank derivatives is established. In particular,
the isotropy and accuracy properties of the proposed approximations are derived directly from this basis. Furthermore, in this
formal development, we extend the theory of Hermite polynomial tensors in the case of discrete spaces and present expressions for
the discrete inner products between monomials and Hermite polynomial tensors. In addition, we prove an equivalency between
two approaches for constructing lattice-Boltzmann stencils. For the numerical verification of the presented finite differences, we
introduce 5th-, 6th-, and 8th-order two-dimensional lattice-Boltzmann stencils.},

  abstract  = {Unlike conventional CFD methods, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) describes the dynamic behaviour of physical systems in a mesoscopic scale, based on discrete forms of kinetic equations. In addition to the classical collision-propagation scheme in which the physical and velocity spaces are coupled, finite-differences, finite volumes and finite-element schemes have been used for numerically solving the discrete kinetic equations. A major breakthrough in LB theory was the direct derivation of the LB equation from continuous kinetic equations, establishing a systematic link between the kinetic theory and the lattice Boltzmann method and determining the necessary conditions for the discretization of the velocity space. The lattices obtained by this method proved to be stable in flows over a wide range of parameters, by the use of high-order lattice Boltzmann schemes, leading to velocity sets which, when used in a discrete velocity kinetic scheme, ensures accurate recovery of the high-order hydrodynamic moments. This review presents the theoretical background of these kinetic methods. In particular, we focus on high-order discrete forms of the Boltzmann equation suitable for non-ideal fluids and on the lattice-Boltzmann collision-propagation method.},

It is here shown for a class of D-dimensional lattice gas models how the macrodynamical (large-scale) equations for the densities of microscopically conserved quantities can be systematically derived from the underlying exact "microdynamical" Boolean equations. With suitable restrictions on the crystallographic symmetries of the lattice and after proper limits are taken, various standard fluid dynamical equations are obtained, including the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two and three dimensions. The transport coefficients appearing in the macrodynamical equations are obtained using variants of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and Boltzmann formalisms adapted to fully discrete situations.},

The article sheds light on the reasons why the method had not enjoyed success in simulating thermohydrodynamic systems before, refs [19--22], and afirms that the SRT BGK approximation is ``sufficient for the purpose of studying hydrodynamics of simple fluids''. It provides a clear, accessible, step-by-step presentation of the discretization of the Boltzmann equation, covering the following requirements: continuous Boltzmann equation without body/external-force term and velocity moments of the single-particle PDF, Section II; discretization in time, Section II-a, calculation of hydrodynamic moments from the discretized data, Section II-b; derivation of the LBE and its EDF, along with its ingredients, Section III; low-Mach number approximation of the EDF, Section III-a; discretization of phase space, Section III-b. In Section IV, some well-known, low order LBE models, such as the D2Q6, D2Q7, D2Q9, and D3Q27, are derived. Some unknown methods are cited, such as the Radau-Gauss numerical integration formula from ref. [35], after which the reading becomes way less clear. The following discussion is confused, as a so-called gas ``speed of light'' and ``speed of sound'' are mentioned, as well as the weights $w_a$ are simply presented, without further explanation. There are $W_a$ and $w_a$ weights in the text. Excellent material to base a presentation of up the the LBE equation, without applying it to a particular lattice configuration. This paper confirms that the integral of vector d\xi expands into multiple (=# of dimensions) integrals of velocity direction and magnitude---hence, of polar form, Eq (20). Paper refs[35, 36] are of fundamentally needed mathematical formulations on numerical quadratures: those of Radau-Gauss and Hermite-Gauss over the half-real axis.},

By uncoupling the velocity lattice from the spatial grid, one can employ higher order (non-space-filling) isotropic lattices—lattices which greatly enhance the stable parameter regions, particularly in thermal problems. In particular, the superiority of the octagonal lattice over previous models used in $2D$ (hexagonal or square) and $3D$ (projected face-centered hypercube) is shown.},

  abstract  = {We present in detail a theoretical framework for representing hydrodynamic systems through a systematic discretization of the Boltzmann kinetic equation. The work is an extension of a previously proposed formulation. Conventional lattice Boltzmann models can be shown to be directly derivable from this systematic approach. Furthermore, we provide here a clear and rigorous procedure for obtaining higher-order approximations to the continuum Boltzmann equation. The resulting macroscopic moment equations at each level of the systematic discretization give rise to the Navier–Stokes hydrodynamics and those beyond. In addition, theoretical indications to the order of accuracy requirements are given for each discrete approximation, for thermohydrodynamic systems, and for fluid systems involving long-range interactions. All these are important for complex and micro-scale flows and are missing in the conventional Navier–Stokes order descriptions. The resulting discrete Boltzmann models are based on a kinetic representation of the fluid dynamics, hence the drawbacks in conventional higher-order hydrodynamic formulations can be avoided.},

  abstract  = {The existing lattice Boltzmann method multispeed thermal models show a limited accuracy. This paper proposes a two-dimensional multispeed thermal model for the finite-difference lattice Boltzmann method ($FDLBM$). To recover correct fluid equations, up to fourth orders of local flow velocity should be retained in the local equilibrium distribution function and tensors of particle velocities should have up to seventh rank isotropy. In the $FDLBM$, particle velocities can be selected independently from the lattice configuration. Therefore, particle velocities of octagonal directions, which have up to seventh rank isotropic tensors, are adopted. The proposed model was verified by two simulations. The model showed excellent numerical stability in addition to strict accuracy.},
